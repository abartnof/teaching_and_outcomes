# The relationship between what we ask of teachers, and students' academic performance
![Summary](summary.png)
The overly glib TL;DR - countries where teachers are paid more have students who learn more

# Introduction

If we make teachers\' jobs a little less stressful, what kinds of educational outcomes can we expect?
Ideally, we'd conduct a randomized manipulation, paying some teachers more, and others less-- but since this kind of manipulation might be unethical (citation needed), we can look at organic examples.

We'll use data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development([OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD)), to see if we can find any overwhelming trends out there.

We'll focus on three metrics that describe teaching:
- Salary (adjusted for PPP)
- The ratio of students to teachers
- How much time teachers spend annually on the clock

One academic outcome: 
- The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a tool that measures 15 year-olds' skills in reading, math, and science

And finally, four social outcomes:
- How flexible a person's work schedule is
- How often a person reads a book
- How often a person is precluded from spending time with their family, because they have to work
- How many hours per week a typical employed person has to work in their primary job
I'll save these four variables for a stats-heavy(er) structural equation model feat. latent variables, because their relationship with the educational system is probably a little looser than, say, PISA scores.

I'm going to be careful about my phrasing here-- I'd _like_ to say that if we do X, we get Y-- but this is hard to say without an experimental situation. 
Instead, I'll describe correlations, with the knowledge that the correlations they describe might be causal, after all.
